## An almost perfect Laptop
The [Lenovo ThinkPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad), in my opinion is probably the closest thing to the best laptop line (for me at least) as someone who has a history of breaking laptops I knew this one would be better than the others I've tried such as the Asus VivoBook line or a HP brand laptop. The overall quality of the ThinkPad cannot be understated, while obviously aluminium laptops exist, cost-wise they're still quite pricey. When I had my VivoBook and I picked it up with 1 hand the whole chassis flexed a considerable amount to the point I was scared it break the motherboard this is due to the plastic being used being polycarbonate plastic, ThinkPads depending on model use GFRP or reinforced ABS plastic and the 'newer' X1 Carbon models use carbon fibre reinforced plastics so even when I try to bend my T480 it's still quite rigid. 

My daily driver is the ThinkPad T480 widely considered "the last great ThinkPad" due to later models from the T490 onwards having things like soldered RAM or not including a hot-swappable battery.
