## An almost perfect Laptop
The [Lenovo ThinkPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad), in my opinion is probably the closest thing to the best laptop line (for me at least) as someone who has a history of breaking laptops I knew this one would be better than the others I've tried such as the Asus VivoBook line or a HP brand laptop. The overall quality of the ThinkPad cannot be understated, while obviously aluminium laptops exist, cost-wise they're still quite pricey. When I had my VivoBook and I picked it up with 1 hand the whole chassis flexed a considerable amount to the point I was scared it break the motherboard this is due to the plastic being used being polycarbonate plastic, ThinkPads depending on model use GFRP or reinforced ABS plastic and the 'newer' X1 Carbon models use carbon fibre reinforced plastics so even when I try to bend my T480 it's still quite rigid. 

My daily driver is the ThinkPad T480 widely considered "the last great ThinkPad" due to later models from the T490 onwards having things like soldered RAM or not including a hot-swappable battery which is something I wanted. I bought a 72mAh battery for my ThinkPad I wanted to make sure there was absolutely no way of it running out during lecture which my VivoBook did often due to its <2 hour battery life. Thankfully checking things like wattage is quite easy so I wanted to keep the wattage down as much as possible. I went with Debian Hyprland, while XFCE or I3 probably would have been even better for battery life, I thought this was a good enough middle ground, I added a 1 TB NVMe SSD into the ThinkPad (if you do the same make sure you know the wattage as some use quite a lot) overall my ThinkPad idles around 8–10 watts and can last normally around 6–12 hours although I could probably stretch it more to around 15 hours if I used some different apps and stopped using winboat for example. I am also thinking about changing the screen to a LPFHD panel which I'm told can be better for the wattage. I've also changed the RAM from 12GB 2400MHz RAM to 16GB 2400MHz.
