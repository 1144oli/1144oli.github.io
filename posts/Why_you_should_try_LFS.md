## What is LFS?
LFS (Linux from Strach) is a type of linux which (shocker) is completely from scratch and built from source, it is also the name of a book<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> which was written by Gerard Beekmans and managed by Bruce Dubbs. 

## Why should I learn LFS?
LFS teaches you about every package on your system, from packages like BinUtils to Grep to Gawk, and what they do, to how to configure everything yourself, you will know your linux system inside out by the end. In the words of Beekmans - "(LFS) serves as an ideal learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators to enhance their (existing) Linux skills." And it does it well. Modern Linux does not require knowledge about what GCC does or how Tar, fstab, or GRUB works, for better may I add, but it's still amazing how much goes into you booting up and using your desktop linux. 

## My experience
I found this quite simple admittedly, I followed a tutorial<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> alongside the LFS book. This tutorial gives a pretty good rundown of it, of course you need an enviroment to build LFS in, the video used the gentoo live ISO<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> it took a longgg time to get the zipped packages, like 4 hours - the GNU FTP server was reallyyyy slow, I did this project on a VM, but the tutorial did it on hardware which would probably be better. Theres a large community for LFS, theres an LFS [discord](https://discord.gg/JqdWH8q) with 100s of members willing to help. One thing, it does take quite abit of time, i'd set atleast a day probably more if you're wanting to under go this challenge.

Probably should have gone with installing Gentoo first before I choose LFS lol
