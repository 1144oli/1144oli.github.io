Mint is often called the 'beginner' distro but I think it would be as apt (haha) to call it the end-game distro. This is due to its simplicity, obviously theres others which are even more simple like [Zorin](https://zorin.com/os/) or [AnduinOS](https://www.anduinos.com/) but mints a good middle ground
