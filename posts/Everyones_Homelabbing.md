# Homelabbing: a new trend

### What is Homelabbing?
A homelab is a personal server used for learning, experimentation, and most importantly self hosting services.
In recent years this has become more and more popular, but especially in the past few months.

### Why?
People homelab for lots of different reasons however, I think the most popular is for freedom, freedom to own your own data, and not have it on someone elses computer (the cloud). But really homelabbing can do alot more; from hosting your own minecraft server to having your own SMD share (like google drive) to even having your own MS office hosted locally (nextcloud) everything is yours, you control it, you own it, and (if you set it up right) only you can see it.
