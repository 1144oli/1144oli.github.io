# Thoughts not big enough for a post.
Some may become posts if they ramble.

### Ricing is fun, but you have to settle down.
In my 2 years on linux I've done alot. From Kali (i know...I'm a cyber security undergrad what did you expect?) to Endevour from Debian to Arch, I've distro-hopped time and time again, but after awhile of spending hour after hour tweaking hyprland.conf it does start to get boring I've come to find making the perfect system is impossible instead I'm going to adapt to the system. I think this is best shown in my progression on my desktop over the past few months from Arch -> Debian -> Mint. 
I hope I enjoy mint, but if I enjoy it too much I may have to switch my laptop too.
