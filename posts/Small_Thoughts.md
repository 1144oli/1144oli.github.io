# Thoughts not big enough for a post.
Some may become posts if they ramble.

### Ricing is fun, but you have to settle down.
In my 2 years on linux I've done alot. From Kali (i know...I'm a cyber security undergrad what did you expect?) to Endevour from Debian to Arch, I've distro-hopped time and time again, but after awhile of spending hour after hour tweaking hyprland.conf it does start to get boring I've come to find making the perfect system is impossible instead I'm going to adapt to the system. I think this is best shown in my progression on my desktop over the past few months from Arch -> Debian -> Mint. 
I hope I enjoy mint, but if I enjoy it too much I may have to switch my laptop too.

### Mint: It just works
I have been using mint for 1 day now. Everything just works. I've only come into one problem, (discord lagging but luckily thats fixed<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>) Looking forward to it. I dont know if I'm going to stick with the software manager though, its really not the best.

If I did youtube, my channel would be tech-oli-gy lol

### X11 vs Wayland
Arch gave me a bleeding edge fix, now I kinda liked having that, hyprland (wayland only), having everything as soon as it came out, now on mint cinnamon (x11 only) I've lost that, while undoubtedly it better to not be in terminal all day long, I'm missing wayland despite what people say, my wayland experience was so much better than it is on x11 (probably due to me having 2 different refresh rate monitors.) My experience has gotten...more bearable definitely, I remember a time when I was stuck at 60hz on my 240hz monitor due to x11, luckily those days are behind us. I guess I have to wait for Cinnamon Wayland to come out of experimental.

<a id="note1">1</a>: Discord lag can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration in Settings -> Advanced -> Hardware Acceleration, but then make sure to use run discord via the decicated GPU, on mint this is very easy just right click on the app dock (which I think is called the task manager on mint) and click 'run with dedicated GPU'.
