# Thoughts not big enough for a post.
Some may become posts if they ramble.

### Ricing is fun, but you have to settle down.
In my 2 years on linux I've done alot. From Kali (i know...I'm a cyber security undergrad what did you expect?) to Endevour from Debian to Arch, I've distro-hopped time and time again, but after awhile of spending hour after hour tweaking hyprland.conf it does start to get boring I've come to find making the perfect system is impossible instead I'm going to adapt to the system. I think this is best shown in my progression on my desktop over the past few months from Arch -> Debian -> Mint. 
I hope I enjoy mint, but if I enjoy it too much I may have to switch my laptop too.

### Mint: It just works
I have been using mint for 1 day now. Everything just works. I've only come into one problem, (discord lagging but luckily thats fixed<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>) Looking forward to it. I dont know if I'm going to stick with the software manager though, its really not the best.

<a id="note1">1</a>: Discord lag can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration in Settings -> Advanced -> Hardware Acceleration, but then make sure to use run discord via the decicated GPU, on mint this is very easy just right click on the app dock (which I think is called the task manager on mint) and click 'run with dedicated GPU'.
